\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In this paper studied how to derive a symbolic executor from concrete definitional interpreters, and presented techniques for structuring definitional interpreters to ease this derivation: free monads for compiling a definitional interpreter into a command tree with a small-step execution strategy, suitable for forking threads of interpretation and doing breadth-first search over how to instantiate symbolic variables in ways that correspond to execution paths through a program, subject to constraints.
We introduced a small constraint language on top of our symbolic executor, and used this language to derive test cases for definitional interpreters for the simply-typed lambda calculus.

In future work, we intend to explore how to make the derivation techniques presented in this paper formally correct, how to automate them, and how to make them efficiently executable, akin to, e.g., miniKanren \cite{Byrd2010thesis}.
